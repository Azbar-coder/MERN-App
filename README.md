In the project directory, you can run:
For Frontend:-
### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

To run backend:-
nodemon server.js


### npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### npm run eject


MERN Stack Application with Role-Based Authentication

To run backend

This is a MERN Stack application that provides role-based access control (RBAC) for users. The application has an Admin and a User role with restricted access to certain pages based on the logged-in user's role.

1. Admin role can access: Dashboard, Reports, and Analytics pages.
2. User role can access: Reports and Analytics pages.

The backend is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The frontend is built using React. The application uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and role-based access control.

Technologies Used


Backend:

Node.js
Express
MongoDB
JWT Authentication
bcryptjs (for hashing passwords)
cors (to handle cross-origin requests)


Frontend:

React
React Router
Axios (for HTTP requests)

Features:-
1. User Authentication (Login using email and password).
2. Role-Based Access Control:
3. Admin can access the Dashboard, Reports, and Analytics pages.
4. Users can only access Reports and Analytics.
5. JWT Authentication: A token is generated after login and used for protected routes.
6. Login Validation: Both frontend and backend validation for email and password.
7. Role Restrictions: Admin and User roles have different access levels to pages.
8. Protected Routes: Only authenticated users with the correct role can access certain pages.
9. Logout: User can log out and the token is removed from local storage.
10. Error Handling: Custom error handling for authentication and authorization errors.
11. API Documentation: API documentation is provided for the backend endpoints.
12. Code Quality: The code is well-structured, readable, and follows best practices.
13. Testing: Unit tests are provided for the backend API endpoints.
14. Security: The application uses HTTPS, and sensitive data is encrypted using bcryptjs.
15. Performance: The application is optimized for performance, and the database is properly indexed.
16. Scalability: The application is designed to scale horizontally and vertically.
17. Maintenance: The code is easy to maintain, and updates are straightforward.
18. Code Review: The code has been reviewed by peers and is free of bugs.

Prerequisites:-
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) – Download and install from Node.js official website.
MongoDB – You can use a local MongoDB server or a cloud solution like MongoDB Atlas.
Postman or any API testing tool – For testing API endpoints.

Conclusion:-
This MERN Stack Application demonstrates how to implement role-based authentication using JWT tokens with both React and Node.js backend. The backend is built with Express, MongoDB, and JWT, while the frontend uses React for the user interface. This guide covers both development and deployment steps.
